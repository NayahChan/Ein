   The purpose of the project was to create an open-source project that would be beneficial to have and have the ability to perform tasks instead of people having to repeatedly perform a laborious task. The hypothesis was that Raspberry Pi’s can be used in a distributive network to operate a dog door with multiple operational tasks that may run individually without human interference. This was tested with an IV of data models used for the identification of objects, such as a collection of pictures for dog 1, dog 2, and random objects, and DV of objects that the RDR door opened to. The RDR door is an appliance that uses a network of robotics that have the ability to work independently and, instead of just using one microcomputer to run multiple functions at the will of a person, do not necessarily need to have a person to operate, a term coined as Macrorobotics. Using two 28byj-48 stepper motors, uln2003 drivers, and a Raspberry Pi Camera with TensorFlow, a dog door that responds to individual dogs using facial recognition was created. TensorFlow performed with an image prediction of 80% to 98% accuracy. The door has the ability to open to dogs with the variable of being allowed outside and close to dogs not allowed to be outside. The results support the idea that TensorFlow is capable of identifying traits of data models and can be applied to Smart Home appliances as it reduces the task for humans to perform a task.
