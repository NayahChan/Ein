    The purpose of the project was to create an open-source project that would be beneficial to have, to be a project anyone can do, and have the ability to perform tasks instead of people having to repeatedly perform a laborious task. The hypothesis was that multiple Raspberry Piâ€™s can be used in a distributive network to operate a dog door with multiple operational tasks that may run individually without human interference. The RDR door is an appliance that uses a network of robotics that have the ability to work independently and, instead of just using one microcomputer to run multiple different functions at the will of a person, do not necessarily have to have a person in the middle to operate, a term coined as Macrorobotics. Using two 28byj-48 stepper motors and uln2003 motor drivers to move the door, and scripts to make motors run in parallel were operated by Flask, an open source microframework that acts as a webserver. These motors were attached to a headless Raspberry Pi Zero, and Raspberry Pi model B was used to run the Flask server, and these are able to open and close a door from a website. For the second version, more components will be added to the door such as time-oriented operation, a harness to call dogs back in from the outdoors, and a camera with live-feed that will be on the website.
