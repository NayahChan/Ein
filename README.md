# Real-time Distributed Robotics
This is my science fair project. 

This project uses modified versions of openCV, HackerShack's Smart-Security-Camera (https://github.com/HackerShackOfficial/Smart-Security-Camera), RaspiWifi (https://github.com/jasbur/RaspiWiFi), and RpiMotorLib (https://github.com/gavinlyonsrepo/RpiMotorLib).
