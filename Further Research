  For the final version, more components will be added to the door such as time-oriented operation, a harness to call dogs back in from the outdoors, and a camera with live-feed that will be on the website. The website will be finalized and we hope to set a baseline for future Smart-Home appliances that go on the market by offering the RDR as an example, meaning that if the door is successful enough it will be put on the market.
