   The results we got from the experimental engineering project was that Tensorflow and computer AI's can be used to assist people in their home environments. The training models used for the camera to identify the objects wanted, in this case, individual dogs with unique features that separate them from other individual dogs, and the actual objects identified by the AI turned out to be accurate. The identification predictions made by TensorFlow once shown the live feed of the dogs and told to identify which dog was there came back in around 80%-98%, which isn't bad at all. We did not get to touch on everything we wanted to do with the RDR door, but using a computer AI to recognize the facial features of different dogs is one of the big points of the door. This goes to show that TensorFlow is capable of identifying specific features of data models and can be applied to the use of Smart Home appliances as it reduces the task for humans to physically perform a function. In the long run, more companies should be using learning AI algorithms as we have in our project. In a broader stance than just opening the RDR door,  in the current time there's a lot of products on the market that carry the moniqure of smart home, and the consumers find out that these products do little to nothing beside play music, search Google, etc. People want impactful technology in thier life, but when they buy things they find out that it's nothing more than just a remote controlled light or thermostat, it doesn't little to improve the quaility of life of the adverage consumer.
