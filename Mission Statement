Mission Statement: 
  The world of home appliances has been a huge topic since 2014, from Amazon Alexa to light bulbs that can turn on from your phone. Although, we don’t think that most of these products are entirely “smart”. We wanted to do this project to create an open-source project that would be beneficial to have and has the ability to perform tasks instead of people having to repeatedly perform a laborious task. The RDR door is an appliance that uses a network of robotics that have the ability to work independently and, instead of just using one microcomputer to run multiple different functions at the will of a person, don’t necessarily have to have a person in the middle to operate, a term we coined as Macrorobotics. Microrobotics meaning that a robot that performs a singular task and Macro meaning a singular instruction that expands a set of instructions to perform a task, Macrorobotics would mean that there are a collection of Microrobotics used in order to perform a task with independence in order to simplify the execution of repetitive tasks.
