Using two 28byj-48 stepper motors and uln2003 motor drivers to move the door, and scripts to make motors run in parallel were operated by Flask, an open source microframework that acts as a webserver. These motors were attached to a headless Raspberry Pi Zero, and Raspberry Pi model B was used to run the Flask server, and these are able to open and close a door from a website.
