Using two 28byj-48 stepper motors and uln2003 motor drivers to move the door, and scripts to make motors run in parallel were operated by Flask, an open source microframework that acts as a webserver. Using a rechargeable battery, the motors and controllers were powered with around 9v. These motors were attached via GPIO to a headless Raspberry Pi Zero, the pi uses a website and Flask to have the user operate the door from local wifi. A door was then 3D modeled in a CAD-like software called Fusion 360, where a prototype was printed out and modified to meet basic standards.
